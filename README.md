# image-to-ascii

A python code that can take a image as input and output a ascii text file that shows the image. 

I first convert the image pixel into greyscale, and map them to index of a list of ascii code list, then print the code on the corresponding pixel in the file.

This code is only suitable for simple, small images. To convert larger, more complex image, it would require larger list of symbols, and possibly better hardware, such as screen.
